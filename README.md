# flutter_json_to_dart_app

A new Flutter project.

## Motivations

Dart does not natively support JSON handling, necessitating the conversion of
JSON into Plain Old Dart Objects (PODO) for effective processing. Recognizing
the need for JSON to PODO tools not only for myself but also for others who
share this goal. I am developing an application that aims to streamline the
process of converting JSON into PODO. By providing an efficient and
user-friendly solution, this app will assist developers in achieving their
objectives more effectively and enhance their productivity when working with
Dart and JSON.

## Log 2023/05/01

JSON and Dart each have their respective datatypes. To ensure coherence and
professionalism, it is necessary to establish a mapping between the JSON
datatypes and the corresponding Dart datatypes. Currently, I am in the process
of determining the comprehensive list of data types that the application will
support.
