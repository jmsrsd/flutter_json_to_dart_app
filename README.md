# flutter_json_to_dart_app

A new Flutter project.

## Motivations

Dart does not natively support JSON handling, necessitating the conversion of
JSON into Plain Old Dart Objects (PODO) for effective processing. Recognizing
the need for such a tool not only for myself but also for others who share this
goal. I am developing an application that aims to stramline the process of
converting JSON into PODO. By providing an efficient and user-friendly solution,
this app will assist developers in achieving their objectives more effectively
and enchance their productivity when working with Dart and JSON.
